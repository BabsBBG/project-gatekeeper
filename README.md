## The Real Story

Years ago I worked the NOC floor for Legend Internet, a Nigerian ISP. I watched our biggest competitor, Spectranet, eat into our subscriber base for years. Then in March 2026, Legend announced plans to merge with Spectranet — a real telecom acquisition with all the identity chaos that comes with it.

Project Gatekeeper simulates that exact scenario. Helix Communications, a UK ISP, acquires Pulse Networks. Overnight, the identity attack surface doubles:

- 400+ Pulse identities — inconsistent naming, no offboarding process
- No MFA on legacy accounts
- Stale accounts and over-privileged users
- Unmanaged contractor and partner access
- Zero detection or automated response

I built a complete identity security framework to fix this. Six phases, 14 custom KQL detection rules mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, 10 live attack simulations with evidence, and a SOAR playbook that contains a compromised account in **2.42 seconds**.

| Metric | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| MFA enforcement | 0% | **100% via CA001** |
| Legacy authentication | Enabled | **Blocked — CA002** |
| Privileged roles | Permanent Global Admin | **JIT with dual approval** |
| Custom detection rules | None | **14 KQL rules** |
| Incident response | Manual — hours | **SOAR — under 3 seconds** |
| Identity Secure Score | N/A | **32.04%** |

## Phase 1 — Identity Baseline

**Goal:** Understand what Pulse brought in, then lock down the foundation before a single legacy identity touches the Helix environment.

### Security Groups

Seven groups: IT Admins, NOC Engineers, Corporate Staff, Field Ops, Break-Glass, PIM Approvers, and Pulse Legacy Users. HLX-IT-Admins is role-assignable — required for PIM in Phase 3.

![Groups list](Phase%201/phase1-task2-groups-list.png)

### Break-Glass Accounts

Two accounts (`bg-01`, `bg-02`) with permanent Global Administrator. Credentials stored offline and never used day-to-day. Excluded from all CA policies and all SOAR automation.

![Break-glass members](Phase%201/phase1-task3-breakglass-members.png)
![BG-01 roles](Phase%201/phase1-task3-breakglass-bg01-roles.png)

### Bulk User Creation via PowerShell

16 users created in one script using Microsoft Graph PowerShell. Each Pulse legacy account (prefixed `pls-`) was created with a documented gap: no MFA, stale, over-privileged, or unlicensed.

![PowerShell creation](Phase%201/phase1-task4-powershell-creation.png)
![Users list](Phase%201/phase1-task4-users-list.png)

### Licensing and Authentication Methods

M365 E5 licences assigned to all users. Authentication methods hardened: Microsoft Authenticator, FIDO2, and Temporary Access Pass enabled. SMS and voice calls disabled.

![Auth methods](Phase%201/phase1-task6-auth-methods.png)

### SSPR

Self-service password reset enabled for all users, two methods required.

![SSPR properties](Phase%201/phase1-task7-sspr-properties.png)
![SSPR methods](Phase%201/phase1-task7-sspr-methods.png)

### Pulse Legacy Gap Remediation

- Disabled `pls-jakub.kiwior` — stale, no activity since acquisition close
- Removed inherited AI Reader and Directory Readers roles from `pls-reiss.nelson` — assigned outside any governance framework

![Kiwior disabled](Phase%201/phase1-task8-kiwior-disabled.png)
![Nelson inherited roles](Phase%201/phase1-task8-nelson-roles.png)

---

## Phase 2 — Conditional Access Architecture

**Goal:** Control who can sign in, from where, and under what conditions — across two merged organisations with different risk profiles.

### Named Locations

Five locations defining the network topology. Helix-NOC-Floor is trusted. Both Pulse locations are known but not trusted — they generate additional scrutiny.

![Named locations](Phase%202/phase2-task1-named-locations.png)

### Seven CA Policies

| Policy | Scope | Control |
|---|---|---|
| CA001 | All users | Require MFA — break-glass excluded |
| CA002 | All users | Block legacy auth (ActiveSync, other clients) |
| CA003 | All users — High/Medium sign-in risk | Require MFA + re-auth every time |
| CA004 | All users — High user risk | MFA + forced password change |
| CA005 | HLX-IT-Admins | MFA + 4hr session, never persistent |
| CA006 | Guest/contractor users | MFA + 1hr session |
| CA007 | Pulse-Partner-Network location | MFA + 2hr session |

All policies started in report-only mode and were moved to enforcement once the environment stabilised — standard enterprise deployment practice.

![CA policy list](Phase%202/phase2-task2-all-policies-list.png)
![CA001](Phase%202/phase2-task2-ca001-require-mfa.png)
![CA002](Phase%202/phase2-task2-ca002-block-legacy-auth.png)
![CA003 sign-in risk](Phase%202/phase2-task2-ca003-signin-risk.png)
![CA007 Pulse partner](Phase%202/phase2-task2-ca007-pulse-partner.png)

---

## Phase 3 — Privileged Identity Management

**Goal:** Zero standing privilege. Every admin role activated just-in-time, with justification and where required, approval from someone outside the IT Admin tier.

### Role Settings

| Role | Max Duration | MFA | Approval |
|---|---|---|---|
| Global Administrator | 4 hours | Required | Required — HLX-PIM-Approvers |
| Security Administrator | 8 hours | Required | Not required |
| Privileged Role Administrator | 4 hours | Required | Required — HLX-PIM-Approvers |

![Global Admin settings](Phase%203/phase3-task2-globaladmin-settings.png)

### Eligible Assignments

Odegaard → Global Admin. Rice → Security Admin. Saliba → Privileged Role Admin. None are active by default. Every elevation is a deliberate, auditable act.

![Eligible assignments](Phase%203/phase3-task3-eligible-assignments.png)

### Separation of Duties

HLX-PIM-Approvers consists of Jurrien Timber and Kai Havertz — Corporate staff, not IT Admins. They cannot approve their own requests because they have none to approve.

![PIM approvers group](Phase%203/phase3-task4-pim-approvers-group.png)
![Global Admin approvers configured](Phase%203/phase3-task4-globaladmin-approvers.png)

### Access Review

Global Administrator eligible assignments reviewed monthly by Timber. Auto-remove on non-response.

![Access review active](Phase%203/phase3-task7-access-review.png)

### Live Activation Simulation

Odegaard requested Global Admin → Timber approved from outside the IT Admin tier. Full audit trail captured.

![Activation request](Phase%203/phase3-task9-activation-request.png)
![Timber approval](Phase%203/phase3-task9-timber-approval.png)

---

## Phase 4 — Identity Lifecycle: JML Workflows

**Goal:** Replace manual helpdesk tickets with automated lifecycle workflows that respond in seconds, not days.

### Joiner

Trigger: user added to `HLX-New-Joiners`. Tasks: Generate Temporary Access Pass, assign default group, send welcome email. The TAP lets new users register MFA without an existing credential — breaking the circular dependency that would otherwise require a helpdesk call.

![Joiner workflow](Phase%204/phase4-task2-joiner-workflow.png)
![Joiner test](Phase%204/phase4-task5-joiner-test.png)

### Mover

Trigger: department attribute change. Tasks: Remove previous group, add new group, notify manager.

![Mover workflow](Phase%204/phase4-task3-mover-workflow.png)
![Mover test](Phase%204/phase4-task6-mover-test.png)

### Leaver

Trigger: user added to `HLX-Offboarding`. Tasks: Disable account, revoke all sessions, remove all groups, strip licences, notify manager before and on final day.

![Leaver workflow](Phase%204/phase4-task4-leaver-workflow.png)
![Leaver test](Phase%204/phase4-task7-leaver-test.png)
![Lokonga disabled](Phase%204/phase4-task7-lokonga-disabled.png)

The leaver workflow also serves as an **emergency containment trigger**. The SOAR playbook in Phase 6 adds compromised accounts to HLX-Offboarding, immediately chaining into the full offboarding sequence.

---

## Phase 5 — ITDR: Threat Detection

**Goal:** Build detection rules that catch Pulse-specific threats, then prove they work with live evidence.

### 14 Custom KQL Rules — MITRE ATT&CK Mapped

All 14 rules deployed as Sentinel scheduled analytics and available in [`/kql-queries/`](kql-queries/).

| Rule | Threat | Severity | Tactic | Technique |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| HLX-DETECT-001 | Break-Glass Account Access | **High** | Initial Access | T1078 |
| HLX-DETECT-002 | Impossible Travel | **High** | Initial Access | T1078 |
| HLX-DETECT-003 | Password Spray | **High** | Credential Access | T1110.003 |
| HLX-DETECT-004 | Role Assigned Outside PIM | **High** | Privilege Escalation | T1098.003 |
| HLX-DETECT-005 | Pulse Legacy Account Activity | Medium | Initial Access | T1078.004 |
| HLX-DETECT-006 | MFA Fatigue / Push Bombing | Medium | Defense Evasion | T1621 |
| HLX-DETECT-007 | Legacy Auth Post-Migration | Medium | Defense Evasion | T1550 |
| HLX-DETECT-008 | After-Hours NOC Access | Medium | Initial Access | T1078 |
| HLX-DETECT-009 | Mass Group Membership Change | **High** | Privilege Escalation | T1098.001 |
| HLX-DETECT-010 | Offboarding Workflow Bypass | Medium | Defense Evasion | T1098 |
| HLX-DETECT-011 | PIM Activation Outside Window | **High** | Privilege Escalation | T1078.004 |
| HLX-DETECT-012 | Pulse Account Impossible Travel | **High** | Initial Access | T1078 |
| HLX-DETECT-013 | Pulse Partner Network Anomaly | Medium | Initial Access | T1078 |
| HLX-DETECT-014 | Risk-Alert Correlation | **High** | Initial Access | T1078 |

![KQL folder](Phase%205/phase5-task4-kql-folder.png)

### 10 Live Attack Simulations

> *A KQL rule that fires but does nothing is a ticket generator. A Sentinel incident that triggers a Logic Apps playbook that revokes, disables, and offboards — that's security.*

Every simulation generated real log entries in the Helix tenant. Advanced Hunting and Entra audit log evidence was captured for 12 of 14 rules.

---

**Simulation 1 — Credential Harvest** (Rules 1, 5)

Attack Simulation Training launched against all four Pulse legacy accounts. Real phishing campaign — real sign-in activity logged.

![Credential harvest results](Phase%205/phase5-sim1-credential-harvest-results.png)
![Phish page — Zinchenko](Phase%205/phase5-sim1-phish-page-zinchenko.png)

---

**Simulation 2 — Password Spray** (Rule 2)

Manual failed logins cycled across all four Pulse accounts from the same browser and IP. Multiple failed attempts, multiple targets, short time window — the signature spray pattern.

![Password spray logs](Phase%205/phase5-sim2-password-spray-logs.png)

---

**Simulation 3 — Role Assigned Outside PIM** (Rule 4)

Direct Security Reader assignment to a Pulse legacy user bypassing PIM entirely. Audit log captured the assignment. Role removed immediately after.

![Role outside PIM audit](Phase%205/phase5-sim3-role-outside-pim-audit.png)

---

**Simulation 4 — Mass Group Membership Change** (Rule 9)

Added three users simultaneously to HLX-IT-Admins. Audit log shows bulk additions in a single 15-minute window — the pattern Rule 9 targets.

![Mass group change audit](Phase%205/phase5-sim4-mass-group-change-audit1.png)
![Mass group change detail](Phase%205/phase5-sim4-mass-group-change-audit2.png)

---

**Simulation 5 — Break-Glass Account Access** (Rule 13)

Signed in as bg-01 from an incognito window. CA policies correctly showed Not Applied — break-glass exclusion working. Identity Protection flagged the unfamiliar IP and interrupted the flow, but the sign-in completed. This is the correct behaviour — emergency access must never auto-block.

![Break-glass signin](Phase%205/phase5-sim5-breakglass-signin.png)
![CA policies not applied](Phase%205/phase5-sim5-breakglass-ca-not-applied.png)
![Identity Protection interrupted](Phase%205/phase5-sim5-breakglass-interrupted.png)
![Advanced Hunting evidence](Phase%205/phase5-sim5-breakglass-advanced-hunting.png)

---

**Simulation 6 — Offboarding Workflow Bypass** (Rule 10)

Disabled pls-reiss.nelson directly without adding to HLX-Offboarding first. Audit log shows AccountEnabled changed to false with no preceding offboarding group entry. Then attempted sign-in on the disabled account — 50057 error confirmed.

![Offboarding bypass audit](Phase%205/phase5-sim6-offboarding-bypass-audit.png)
![Account locked 50057](Phase%205/phase5-sim6-account-locked.png)

---

**Simulation 7 — MFA Fatigue** (Rule 6)

Repeatedly signed in as Bukayo Saka and denied the MFA push each time. Sign-in logs show the Interrupted → Interrupted → Interrupted → Success pattern — exactly what push bombing looks like in logs.

![MFA fatigue sign-in logs](Phase%205/phase5-sim7-mfa-fatigue-signin-logs.png)
![MFA fatigue Advanced Hunting](Phase%205/phase5-sim7-mfa-fatigue-advanced-hunting.png)

---

**Simulation 8 — Legacy Authentication** (Rule 7)

PowerShell sent a Basic Auth HTTP request to the Exchange MAPI endpoint. 401 Unauthorized — CA002 blocked it at the protocol level.

![Legacy auth 401](Phase%205/phase5-sim8-legacy-auth-401.png)

---

**Simulation 9 — Impossible Travel** (Rules 1, 12)

Signed in as pls-oleksandr.zinchenko from Nigeria, then immediately via VPN from the US and Belgium. Three countries in minutes. Sign-in logs and Advanced Hunting both capture the pattern.

![Impossible travel Advanced Hunting](Phase%205/phase5-sim9-impossible-travel-advanced-hunting.png)

> CA003 did not block this sign-in — and that is correct. Impossible travel is a post-sign-in detection. Both sign-in events must occur before the pattern can be calculated. By the time Identity Protection scores it, the session exists. CA004 catches the elevated user risk on the next sign-in. This is how the detection chain is designed.

---

**Simulation 10 — PIM Activation Anomaly** (Rule 11)

Odegaard activated Global Administrator. Full PIM audit log captured with timestamp — the evidence Rule 11 queries for out-of-window activations.

![PIM activation audit](Phase%205/phase5-sim10-pim-activation-audit.png)

---

**VPN Risky Sign-in** (Baseline evidence — Rules 1, 5)

The first foreign VPN test that kicked off the detection work. Identity Protection flagged the sign-in, CA003 enforced MFA, and the risky sign-ins dashboard populated for the first time.

![Risky sign-ins](Phase%205/phase5-vpn-risky-signins.png)
![Risk detections](Phase%205/phase5-vpn-risk-detections.png)
![CA003 block](Phase%205/phase5-vpn-ca003-block.png)

---

## Phase 6 — Response Automation and Governance

**Goal:** Close the detection-to-response loop. Prove the whole system works end-to-end.

### Enable All CA Policies

No more report-only. All 7 policies enforced.

![All CA policies enabled](Phase%206/phase6-task1-all-ca-enabled.png)

### Access Reviews

Global Admin monthly review — Timber approved Odegaard. Pulse legacy quarterly review configured for external identities.

![Access review approval](Phase%206/phase6-task2-access-review-approval.png)
![Pulse legacy review](Phase%206/phase6-task3-pulse-legacy-review.png)

### Deploy Sentinel

Log Analytics workspace created. Entra ID, MDI, and M365 Defender data connectors connected. All 14 KQL rules deployed as scheduled analytics with MITRE ATT&CK tactic and technique mapping.

![Log Analytics workspace](Phase%206/phase6-task4-law-workspace.png)
![All 14 analytics rules active](Phase%206/phase6-task4-all-analytics-rules.png)
![Sentinel overview](Phase%206/phase6-task4-sentinel-overview.png)

### SOAR Playbook: HLX-SOAR-HighRiskResponse

**Trigger:** HTTP webhook — lab implementation. Production uses Sentinel incident automation rule.

```

![Break-glass still enabled](Phase%206/phase6-task5-breakglass-still-enabled.png)

### Final Secure Score

32.04% post-acquisition, with the full control stack active. The score reflects bringing 400+ Pulse accounts into the MFA registration calculation — expected to climb above 70% as legacy users complete registration and controls continue to mature.

![Final Secure Score](Phase%206/phase6-task6-final-secure-score.png)

## What I Learned the Hard Way

**Lifecycle Workflows need Entra ID Governance** — a separate trial licence on top of E5. I activated the free trial and it unlocked immediately. Not obvious until you hit the 401 on the overview page.

**Access reviews in trial tenants** — the My Access portal sometimes doesn't surface PIM reviews for reviewers despite correct licence assignment and 24+ hours. The email notification with direct link works. The configuration is correct.

**Sentinel entity extraction is unreliable in trial workspaces** — the built-in Entities - Get Accounts action consistently returned empty results for both analytics-rule-generated and manually created incidents. Switched to an HTTP webhook trigger and passed the UPN directly. In a production Sentinel workspace with sufficient ingestion history, the native trigger works correctly. The response chain logic — revoke, disable, offboard, notify — is fully validated regardless of trigger method.

---

## Reproduce This Project

```bash
# Prerequisites: Terraform CLI, Azure CLI, M365 E5 trial tenant
az login
az account set --subscription "your-subscription"

cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Terraform covers: all Entra ID groups, all 21 users, all 7 CA policies, all 5 named locations, all PIM eligible assignments, Log Analytics workspace, Sentinel, and all 14 KQL analytics rules as scheduled analytics.

Resources deployed via alternative methods are documented in [`/terraform/README.md`](terraform/README.md):
- Lifecycle Workflows - Entra ID portal, definitions in [`/scripts/`](scripts/)
- Logic Apps SOAR - ARM template in [`/logic-apps/`](logic-apps/)
